A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has  decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to  purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a  higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set  from the sale of houses in Australia.
Business Goal : You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This  model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.  They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.  Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
